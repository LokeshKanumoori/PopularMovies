    <string name="fake_detail_movie_review">Featuring appealing covers of hit songs and an all-star cast,
        this cute animated comedy capitalizes on the craze for both talking-animal adventures and talent competitions.
        The movie may not have the substance of Inside Out or the overt messages of Zootopia, but, like Trolls, it\'s simple,
        with catchy pop music and jokes that are likely to make kids laugh. (Unlike Trolls, its take-aways aren\'t quite as
        thoroughly positive \-\- see below.) The musical numbers are by far the best part of the movie, including Jennifer
        Hudson-voiced renditions of \"Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight\" to the piggy duet of \"Shake It Off\" (by Witherspoon
        and comedian Nick Kroll as a German boar called Gunter) to Kelly\'s show-stopping version of "Hallelujah."</string>
